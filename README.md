# Tom Journey

ðŸš€ **Live**: [https://p10q.github.io/tom-journey/](https://p10q.github.io/tom-journey/) 

This is an experiment in designing in code using Claude Code. Currently taking School of Motion courses and exploring why programming animations directly in code might be more flexible than forcing UI-based view models (like Rive) to do what we want.

## Built With
